# CV-DL: Using Style Transfer for Data Augmentation
by Meltem Coroz and Susan Potters 

## Introduction
This repository contains code for the project of the course CS4245. The project was done on Google Colab, and therefore this repository contains three differrent notebooks.

The goal of this project was to generate stylized images and add these to the training set. Moreover, images were augmented using traditional augmentation and added to the training set. Next, the influence of adding stylized, augmented, and a combination of both was examined for the models VGG16 and VGG19. 

## Content

- `augmentations.ipynb`: contains code to augment images and save them in a Drive directory.

- `style_transfer.ipynb`: contains code to stylize images and save them in a Drive Directory.

- `train_network.ipynb`: contains code to train VGG16 and VGG19 and evaluate their test accuracies.
